## BZNS fixes
* Module for PF2e with 'little grain' of homerules of BZNS (which you can ignore, ofc)
* Most of content was create for private use
*
* This module provide presonal vision for few classes and mechanics like...
* ...What if spellcasters improved at the same levels as martials?
* ...What if they are had fundamental runes too?
* ...What if they doesn't have levels with nothing?
* ...What if designer for spellcasters doesn't was so... khem.
* *
* In general, in module you can find journal with all changes.
* Enjoy?
