## BZNS fixes
* Module for PF2e with 'little grain' of homerules of BZNS (which you can ignore, ofc)
* Most of content was create for private use

* This module provide vision of one person for few classes and mechanics.
* What if spellcasters improved at the same levels as martials?
* If they had fundamental runes too.
* If they doesn't have levels with nothing.
* If designer for spellcasters doesn't was so.. khem.
* In general, in module you can find journal with all changes.
* Enjoy?
